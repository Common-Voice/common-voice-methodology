A living document outlining a methodological approach for building read speech sentence corpora.

Goal & approach
===============

The goal of this repository/living document is two-fold:

1. To outline a well-researched and methodological approach for the construction of sentence-based corpora designated for recording, and thus to serve as the basis of read speech corpora.
2. To outline a well-researched and methodological approach for the collection of recordings of such a sentence-based corpora.

This is done by advising with domain experts and integrating conclusions and lessons learned from past research in the field.

The approach taken here is simple:

- First, the premise is set, detailing the various aspects of corpus construction and collection that require attention, and the possible approaches to each aspect.
- Then, a set of best practices is suggested, corresponding to the list of aspects detailed in the premise. Where a wide concensus has been reached by advising parties, a single best practice is suggested; otherwise, in the case of differing opinions, several approaches are outlined, and the possible implications of the choice between them is detailed, where possible.


Premise
=======

Corpus construction
-------------------

A methodological approach for the construction of said corpora is required to address several aspects of the construction process:

- **Data source:** The data source from which the sentences composing the corpus are extracted.

  - **Licensing:** The license under which texts from the data source are licensed.
  - **Data source type:** Newspaper, social network site, book, articles, conversation transcripts, transcripts of official precedings, etc.
  - **Data source count:** The number of different data sources sentences are sampled from (e.g. the number of different new websites, books, etc.).
  - **Register:** The register in which the text is written (or in which the transcribed speech was spoken). E.g. Formatl vs. consultative vs. casual.
  - **Time of origin:** The time source text or speech were recorded.
- Dataset size:
- Sampling method:


Sentence collection
-------------------

A methodological approach for the collection of said speech corpora is required to address several aspects of the collection process:

- Recording equipment:
- Recording environment:
- Collected metadata:
- Number of recordings per sentence:
- Validation method:
